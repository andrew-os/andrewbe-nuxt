        <p>Iâ€™ve spent the past three years working purely as a Front End Developer, in London.</p>
        <p>This was mostly developing sites for Wordpress with the occasional static site or Single Page App.</p>
        <p>Previous to that I worked as a full stack developer.</p>
        <p>
            I am currently focussing more on getting away from the Wordpress work flow and developing a more engineer way of coding, using the latest technologies.
