        <p>Having worked as a Frontend developer for numerous years I have worked on 100's of websites.</p>
        <p class="text-txtwhite text-1xl mb-4">These are websites Iâ€™ve built and worked on recently that showcase different designs, features and coding methods:</p>
        
        <projectlist />
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This site is a Vue/Nuxt clone of my personal <a href="https://andrewbe.me" target="_blank">site</a>(built with React/Gatsby)</p>
        <p>I've always found learning on the job a great way of wrapping my head around concepts.</p>
